## Memos

- I still want to try Vim.
  - [Vim](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>)
  - Using vim to edit HTML/CSS/JS files? I think I need ESline and Prettier plug-in.
  - Create a '.vimrc' file in home folder for current user. Setup backup shell script.
  - [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- I wanted to adjust theme of this blog to a darker theme. Need to research on how to do it.
