> I'm testing some features of Hexo. This is a messy post. So be it.

## TODO

- [ ] A post about my hexo blog setting.

## Checklist Test

- [ ] Test checkbox syntax.
- [ ] Does this work? (Yes, it works.)
- [x] This is a checked checkbox.
- These syntax below does not work.
  [ ] Checkbox syntax test 2.
  [x] Checkbox syntax test 3.

## Something I Tested

- I did a few tests on this theme. h1 would be the same as title of the page and same size in quotes.
- I tested generating a draft markdown file by hexo-cli. And tried publishing it by cli.
- If I don't want draft documents be pushed to Github repo, I will need to add the file to .gitignore.
- Removed keybinding for "ctrl+space" of Trigger Suggest in Visual Studio Code in Xubuntu. Fcitx is still not working.

## Test Markdown h2 size

I'm not sure how would this look like.
