## Daily Notes

I tested some basic markdown features of this theme, Minos. And I changed the theme to “atom-one-dark” for the code block syntax highlighting. I pushed the code of this blog to the main branch of the repo and the page showing to gh-pages branch for Github pages to show. So I can write from different machines and put things up to this blog.

I think I did the same thing, making a blog with hexo, a few years ago. This time I should write a note in detail about the process for future reference.
